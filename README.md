# *xAFCL EE* - Portable and scalable enactment engine to run serverless workflows across multiple FaaS systems

This project provides a portable and scalable middleware service *xAFCL Enactment Engine (xAFCL EE)* that can simultaneouusly execute individual functions of a serverless workflow application (Function Choreographies - *FCs*) across multiple FaaS systems (AWS Lambda, IBM Cloud Functions, Google Cloud Functions, Alibaba Function Compute, and Microsoft Functions). 

*xAFCL EE* is the core part of the overall [AFCL Environment](https://github.com/sashkoristov/AFCLEnvironment), a platform to develop, deploy, and fault tolerant execution of FCs developed in our Abstract Function Choreography Language ([AFCL](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2020.08.012)).

*xAFCL EE* integrates the component `FTjFaaS` for optional fault tolerant execution of FC functions (currently supported AWS Lambda and IBM Cloud Functions).


## Versions

The initial version of the *xAFCL EE* was developed as a part of a bachelor thesis at the University of Innsbruck, Computer Science Department (among top three bachelor theses in 2019):

* Bachelor thesis: Multi-provider enactment engine (EE) for serverless workflow applications
* students: Jakob NÃ¶ckl, Markus Moosbrugger
* supervisor: Sashko Ristov
* Final presentation: June, 2019


## File structure

- **[externalJars](externalJars)** contain pre-build jars used within the EE. Keep them upToDate if they work properly.
- **[src/main](src/main)** 
    - **[/java](src/main/java)** contains the source code of the EE.
    - **[/resources](src/main/resources)** contains example yaml files to test the execution.
- You will need to create a **credentials.properties** file in the root directory of the project, which contains the login credentials for the FaaS providers. This file will be ignored from git (**[.gitignore](.gitignore)**).

    The file should look as follows:
    ````
    aws_access_key=<your_aws_access_key>
    aws_secret_key=<your_aws_secret_key>
    aws_session_token=<your_aws_session_token> (e.g., for AWS Educate)
    ibm_api_key=<your_ibm_api_key>
    ````

## Deploy

### Local
<!--- Configure the line mainClassName = 'at.enactmentengine.serverless.main.Local' instead of mainClassName = 'at.enactmentengine.serverless.main.Service' to build a jar for local execution. --->

Simply run the [main method in Local.java](src/main/java/at/enactmentengine/serverless/main/Local.java) and pass the workflow yaml file as parameter, as well as the input JSON file. 
 
or 
 
````
gradle standalone
````


### Service
Run the [main method in Service.java](src/main/java/at/enactmentengine/serverless/main/Service.java). The Service will wait on port 9000 for a `.yaml` file and return the result of the execution in json format.

or

````
gradle shadowJar       
````
<!---
### Docker
````
gradle updateDocker         // to start the service in a docker container with a gradle task.
````

Alternatively, follow [/docker/README.md](docker/README.md) to run the container without gradle. --->
<!---
NOT SUPPORTED RIGHT NOW:

### AWS
1. Create an AWS Lambda function representing the EE (Upload the .jar)
   ````
   Runtime: Java8
   Handler: at.enactmentengine.serverless.main.LambdaHandler::handleRequest
   ````
2. Invoke the function with a specific input file:
    ````
    {
      "filename": "<your_workflow.yaml>",
      "language": "yaml"
    }
    ````
    or
    ````
    {
      "workflow": "<your_workflow_json_string>",
      "language": "json"
    }
    ````
    Use tools like https://www.json2yaml.com/ to convert from yaml to json and https://www.freeformatter.com/json-escape.html to escape characters.
    
### IBM
1. Create an IBM action representing the EE
    ````
    wsk action create EnactmentEngine <exported_ee.jar> --main at.enactmentengine.serverless.main.OpenWhiskHandler#main
    ````
2. Invoke the action with a specific input file:
    Input:
    ````
    wsk action invoke --result EnactmentEngine --param filename <your_workflow.yaml>
    ````
    or
    ````
    {
      "filename": "<your_workflow.yaml>",
      "language": "yaml"
    }
    ````
    or
    ````
    {
      "workflow": "<your_workflow_json_string>",
      "language": "json"
    }
    ````
    Use tools like https://www.json2yaml.com/ to convert from yaml to json and https://www.freeformatter.com/json-escape.html to escape characters.

## Fault Tolerance

The *xAFCL EE* will automatically pass functions with fault tolerance and constraint settings to the fault tolerance module (`FTjFaaS`) for execution.

### Features

This section will show the features of the Fault Tolerance engine with some very simple examples. All examples are based on the following simple workflow (only the constraints field of a function needs to be changed within the CFCL file):

````yaml
name: "exampleWorkflow"
workflowBody:
- function:
    name: "hello"
    type: "helloType"
    properties:
    - name: "resource"
      value: "python:https://eu-gb.functions.cloud.ibm.com/<link.to.function>/hello.json"
    constraints:
    - name: "<FT-Name>"
      value: "<FT-Value>"
    dataOuts:
    - name: "message"
      type: "string"
dataOuts:
- name: "OutVal"
  type: "string"
  source: "hello/message"
````

- **FT-Retries** and **FT-AltStrat-requiredAvailability**

First we specify the number of times a function should be retried (`FT-Retries`) before the alternative strategy is executed. Additionally we can specify the required availability (`FT-AltStrat-requiredAvailability`) as a double value. `FT-Retries` is mandatory, while `FT-AltStrat-requiredAvailability` is optional when using the fault tolerant execution. 

````yaml
constraints:
- name: "FT-Retries"
  value: "2"
- name: "FT-AltStrat-requiredAvailability"
  value: "0.9"
````

The `FT-AltStrat-requiredAvailability` requires some additional steps to find the alternative plan which is understandable by *xAFCL EE*. For simplicity you can use the `addAlternativePlansToYAML()` method from [AlternativePlanScheduler](src/main/java/at/enactmentengine/serverless/scheduler/AlternativePlanScheduler.java) to find alternative plan(s). 
<!--- Please note that this might be changed in the future and this method will be ported to another module.-->

In order for the [AlternativePlanScheduler](src/main/java/at/enactmentengine/serverless/scheduler/AlternativePlanScheduler.java) to work properly the following steps are required:

1. A database with function invocations is required to retrieve old executions. Example: [FTDatabase.db](Database/FTDatabase.db). The database should contain the function which will be executed in the **Function** table.
2. (To generate random invocations to fill the database [DataBaseFiller](src/main/java/at/enactmentengine/serverless/main/DataBaseFiller.java) can be used) 
3. Now the `addAlternativePlansToYAML("path/to/file.yaml", "path/to/newly/created/optimizedFile.yaml")` can be used to generate the alternative strategy at runtime.
4. The optimized file can now be executed by the *xAFCL EE*.

Possible output from `addAlternativePlansToYAML()`:
````yaml
constraints:
    - name: "FT-AltPlan-0"
      value: "0.9879;https://jp-tok.functions.appdomain.cloud/api/v1/web/<link.to.function>/hello.json;https://eu-gb.functions.cloud.ibm.com/api/v1/web/<link.to.function>/hello.json;"
    - name: "FT-AltPlan-1"
      value: "0.9808;https://eu-de.functions.appdomain.cloud/api/v1/web/<link.to.function>/hello.json;https://us-south.functions.appdomain.cloud/api/v1/web/<link.to.function>/hello.json;"
````

The following example would invoke each function within an alternative plan `2` times:
````yaml
constraints:
    - name: "FT-Retries"
      value: "2"
    - name: "FT-AltPlan-0"
      value: "0.9879;https://jp-tok.functions.appdomain.cloud/api/v1/web/<link.to.function>/hello.json;https://eu-gb.functions.cloud.ibm.com/api/v1/web/<link.to.function>/hello.json;"
    - name: "FT-AltPlan-1"
      value: "0.9808;https://eu-de.functions.appdomain.cloud/api/v1/web/<link.to.function>/hello.json;https://us-south.functions.appdomain.cloud/api/v1/web/<link.to.function>/hello.json;"
````

- **C-latestStartingTime**

````yaml
constraints:
- name: "C-latestStartingTime"
  value: "2011-10-02 18:48:05.123"
````

will throw an `at.uibk.dps.exception.LatestStartingTimeException` if the start time of the function is before the specified time. 

- **C-latestFinishingTime**

````yaml
constraints:
- name: "C-latestFinishingTime"
  value: "2011-10-02 18:48:05.123"
````

will throw an `at.uibk.dps.exception.LatestFinishingTimeException` if the function did not finish before the specified time.

- **C-maxRunningTime**

````yaml
constraints:
- name: "C-maxRunningTime"
  value: "1240"
````

will stop waiting for a response of the cloud function after `1240` milliseconds. The *xAFCL EE* will throw an `at.uibk.dps.exception.MaxRunningTimeException` exception if the specified runtime is exceeded.
